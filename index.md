>Every game should make sure they still work at some level without central server support. Even when not looking at end of life concerns, being able to work when the internet is down is valuable. If you can support some level of LAN play for a multiplayer game, the door is at least open for people to write proxies in the future. Supporting user-run servers as an option can actually save on hosting costs, and also opens up various community creative avenues.

**BunkerGames** is a small-at-home personal curation game server hosting based on several ideas about [game preservation](https://www.wired.com/story/fate-future-video-game-preservation-you/), [permacomputing](https://permacomputing.net/Principles/), [vaporwave feelings](https://www.johnhuntpublishing.com/zer0-books/our-books/babbling-corpse), [sustainable principles](https://www.sustainablewebmanifesto.com/) and lots of interests about eerie [abandoned game servers](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamingsuggestions/comments/tz5fgk/abandoned_multiplayer_worlds_games_that_can_still/) stories I'm working on my spare time.

Some of theses games are outdated, others were discontinued or are hardly modded and other are underrated and therefore not so popular. If you like to play a game you don't need to access in a private panel and start to struggling with a lots of file configurations or bunch of parameters.

Think out of this project as a small and independent book publisher. I'm not interested in large infraestructures, last cutting-edge hardware state of art or whatever is related of a commercial big company. I prefer to explore other titles that most of them are out of the focus or simply it doesn't have any support.

If you're looking for a fancy bare metal servers, professional services and cloud computing gaming better I'll suggest you this list of companies: [PingPerfect](https://pingperfect.com/), [Citadel Server](https://citadelservers.com/), [Creeperhost](https://www.creeperhost.net/), [Akliz](https://www.akliz.net/), [GPortal](https://www.g-portal.com/es), [Host Havoc](Host Havoc), [ScalaCube](https://scalacube.com/) or [Apex Game Hosting](https://apexminecrafthosting.com/games/). I'm not affiliate with none of them, just a recommendation if you want to setup your game server.

## How can I stop a server wipe out?

Most of the game servers have an CPU impacte and therefore this means more Watts and more electric consume. I was thinking of how to maintining the free play and combining the free donations and at the end I thought that data world would be wiped every month if nobody wants to mainting it. This means you can play free but knowing all the stuff you build or earn on the game will be wipe out after a month. If you want to extends its life you need to make a one payment (not a subscription) and the wipe out clock will be reset.

Due the costs of the electric bills server will be off from 8am to 14pm ([CET](https://time.is/CET)) from Monday to Friday.

You don't need to pay for play any of the available games but any help to pay the electric bills and improve the server hardware will always welcome: [https://paypal.me](https://paypal.me/xbelanch). If you supported the games or pay for mantain the server data you'll get a personal invitation for the Discord Server.
